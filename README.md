# ChatBot Documentation

## Introduction

This is a simple console-based chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot is designed to learn and answer questions based on user input. It uses a JSON file (`train_info.json`) to store the training data.

## Features

- **Training**: The chatbot can be trained by providing new questions and answers.
- **Closest Match**: It identifies the closest matching question to the user's input and responds accordingly.
- **Interactive**: The chatbot runs in an interactive console, allowing users to have a conversation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. **Installation**: No special installation is required. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Run the ChatBot**:

    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

    ''' Using Vs terminal
        run python file
    '''

4. **Conversation**: The chatbot will prompt you to enter your input. Type your questions or type "quit" to exit the conversation.

5. **Teach the Bot**: If the bot doesn't know the answer, it will ask for your input. Provide the correct answer to teach the bot.
